    <meta name="description" content="The GraphSys workshop is linked to the Graph-Massivizer project funded by the Horizon Europe research and innovation program of the European Union for the period 2023-2026. The project aims to develop a high-performance, scalable, gender-neutral, secure, and sustainable platform for massive graph processing.
The GraphSys workshop is supported by the following organizations and projects:

HiPEAC - Bridging industry and academia in computing systems
BDVA - Big Data Value Association
Project EXTRACT - a distributed data-mining software platform for extreme data across the compute continuum
Project SYCLOPS - scaling extreme analytics with cross-architecture acceleration based on open standards, and advancing AI/data mining by democratizing its acceleration through open standards
Project ExtremeXP - EXPeriment driven and user eXPerience oriented analytics for eXtremely Precise outcomes and decisions
PISTIS - Promoting and Incentivising Federated, Trusted, andFairSharing and Trading of Interoperable Data Assets
enRichMyData project - creating a novel paradigm for building rich, high-quality, valuable, and FAIR-compliant datasets to feed downstream BDA and AI applications in the context of data-sharing ecosystems
UPCAST project - universal, trustworthy, transparent, and user-friendly data market plugins for the automation of data sharing and processing agreements between businesses, public administrations and citizens
DataPACT project - integrating compliance into data pipelines, it aims to help organizations unlock the full potential of their data while safeguarding fundamental rights and fostering trust and transparency
TwinShip project - facilitating knowledge exchange to support offshore wind growth
NexusForum.eu project - a physical event aimed at exploring technological synergies between the European Alliance for Industrial Data, Edge and Cloud, the EU companies and Members States involved in the IPCEI on Cloud Infrastructure &amp; Services, and the community of EU-funded research and innovation projects
CEI-Sphere.eu project - driving the Cloud-Edge-IoT Large-Scale Pilots and supporting the development of an open, interoperable, and competitive ecosystem.
EUCloudEdgeIoT.eu project - realising a pathway for the understanding and development of the Cloud, Edge and IoT (CEI) Continuum by promoting cooperation between a wide range of research projects, developers and suppliers, business users and potential adopters of this new technological paradigm.
