Aligned with Euro-Par, the premier European conference addressing all facets of parallel and distributed processing, GraphSys'25 is the first Workshop on Serverless, Extreme-Scale, and Sustainable Graph Processing Systems. GraphSys is a cross-disciplinary meeting venue focusing on state-of-the-art and emerging (future) graph processing systems. 

The workshop is designed for researchers, practitioners, and students interested in sustainable graph processing. Participants from academia, industry, (government) research labs, and nonprofit organizations are encouraged to attend and contribute to the GraphSys discussions and collaborations.

### Paper submission
We welcome submissions via EasyChair of full papers (12 pages), as well as work-in-progress, experience, and position papers (6 pages).

#### Topics of interest for GraphSys'25 include:

 - System architectures and system designs for graph creation, enrichment, graph query, and graph analytics.
 - Programming and data-level interfaces, APIs, and models for graph processing.
 - Benchmarks, performance monitoring, measurement techniques, methods, metrics, tools, and instruments for graph processing.
 - Sustainability metrics, tools, and instruments for real-world, analytical, and simulation-based approaches to performance analysis for graph processing systems.
 - Parallel and distributed (including heterogeneous) algorithms and methods for graph processing.  
 - Serverless techniques, addressing graph processing challenges of full-automation software and data services with fine granularity and utilization-based billing.
 - Empirical case studies of graph processing environments, applications, and systems, including comparative performance studies and benchmarking of real-world and production graph-processing systems.
 - Methodological aspects of software engineering, performance engineering, and computer systems related to graph processing.


All submissions are required in PDF format and will be sent via EasyChair.
